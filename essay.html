                The purpose of this doc is to set intentions, expectations, and accountability mechanisms for the
                upcoming summer. This is in an effort to maximize value derived from what I see as a relatively flexible
                few months in terms of both time allocation and possible outcomes.<a href="#f1" id="ref1"
                    class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                A few predicates before I begin:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. I’ve done pushes (heads down / founder mode / intense sprints) before—all have been valuable, but
                many have been unsustainable.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. I see the next few months as an opportunity to do a push with a clear end date, whereas previous
                pushes may have led to slow downs due to a converse ambiguity.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. The very definition of this push, though, is different; it must be a push toward all my goals, not
                just work or some other singular outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. So, this doc will serve to: (a) set those goals, (b) articulate how I want to go about them and how
                I’ll continue in the face of challenge, and (c) help supporters (primarily Jeremi) hold me to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, I’ll start with hard dates that the below priorities must work around.
            </p>

            <b>Notes</b>
            <p>
                <a id="f1" href="#ref1" class="footnote-back">[1]</a>
                Currently we do the opposite: when we make kids do boring work, like arithmetic drills, instead of
                admitting frankly that it's boring, we try to disguise it with superficial decorations.
            </p>
