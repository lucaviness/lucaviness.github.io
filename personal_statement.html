          “Skyhawk Eight Niner Three, departing Runway Two Niner,” I called over the radio as I pushed in the throttle and released the brakes. My father, sitting in the seat beside me, was silent, with a mix of terror and pride. He had taught me how to drive just a year before, and now I was flying him fifty miles to Clear Lake, CA for lunch. I was grinning ear to ear all the way up to 6,500 feet; he was my first passenger after becoming a private pilot. Explaining my journey to this moment is essential to understanding who I am.

          Flying is truly a passion of mine. There’s no better word to describe my obsession with and love for aviation. The strongest pull has certainly been the mental challenge it provides as I have always searched for ways to stimulate my curiosity. In sixth grade, for example, I took a semester-long Intermediate Algebra course at my local community college. It was the first time I felt academically challenged, and walking into a class full of college students eight to twelve years older than me was thrilling. I not only had to learn the material, but how to study and take effective notes: I failed the first test because I had no idea how to properly prepare, and yet I felt like I belonged in that class more than any other. I passed the course and was immediately longing for more.

          I have embraced the challenge of earning my pilot license with the same enthusiasm and drive. Intellectually, it’s the hardest thing I have ever done, combining math, physics, navigation, communication, focus, and constant decision-making. It’s dangerous, so great attention to detail is necessary to prioritize safety. On top of that, I had to figure out how I would pay for it. After my discovery flight on my fourteenth birthday, the instructor asked me what the next step was. I hesitantly responded, “Read the manual?” “No,” she said, “get a job!”

          And, so I did. The next day, as an eighth grader, I came home with a work permit for my parents to sign—I had gotten my first tutoring job at Kumon. Throughout high school, I continued to tutor and, in my junior year, started a math tutoring business of my own. It has since grown to seventeen regular K-12 students.

          Combining my interests in aviation and economics, and in continued pursuit of my pilot license, I got a paid internship last summer doing market analysis and portfolio management for an aircraft leasing firm serving major airlines worldwide. It was exhilarating to commute by ferry into San Francisco to work with adults solving challenging business problems involving billions of dollars in assets. I particularly enjoyed analyzing industry trends to support the marketing and legal teams in lease contract negotiation. With my ambition to go into finance clearer than ever and my pilot license becoming a reality, my hard work and determination were paying off.

          Still needing more income to complete flight training, I also became the evening and weekend cashier at a local Puerto Rican restaurant. I loved the fast-paced environment, interaction with the public, and of course the food (I am, after all, a seventeen-year-old boy). Incidentally, I leveraged the use of checklists in aviation to optimize various tasks, such as making the complex drink station easier for my coworkers to run.

          This summer, I worked three jobs, took a college economics course, and earned my pilot license. I often woke up at 5 a.m. and commuted between home, airport, office, and restaurant. It was the busiest I’ve ever been, but it was by far one of the most rewarding and enjoyable summers I’ve had—I hustled and achieved my goals. This encapsulates who I am: driven, engaged, and intellectually curious. I thrive in challenging environments and am eager to spread my wings at the university level.
